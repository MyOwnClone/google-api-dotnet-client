Directions for setting up the development environment:



# Requirements #
To use this library, you will either need
  * Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 (or higher)

# Downloading the libraries #

The Google .NET Client library can be downloaded [here](Downloads.md).

# IDE #

We recommend using an IDE to develop in C#. You can find a small list of common choices below:

## Visual Studio ##
On Windows the easiest solution is to use [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express) or [Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products) as an IDE. Visual Studio is the most common used IDE, and offers great support for C#.

## Mono Develop (NOT OFFICIAL SUPPORTED ANY MORE) ##
  * To develop under Unix, we recommend using [Mono Develop](http://monodevelop.com/), which is the Unix equivalent of Visual Studio.

  * If you have a Debian based distribution (e.g. Ubuntu), you can install it by executing the command below:
```
sudo apt-get install monodevelop
```

  * You also need to install a compiler by executing the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install mono-gmcs
```

# Source Control #
This project uses Mercurial for source control. If you want to contribute to this project, you should download and install "hg". If you just wish to use the library, you can also download the .zip archives instead.

_Windows users:_
  * Download and install [Tortoise Hg](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/)

_Unix users:_
  * Install hg by e.g. running:
```
sudo apt-get install mercurial 
```
