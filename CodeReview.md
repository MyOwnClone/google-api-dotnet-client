# Code Review #

The process of doing a code review is pretty simple and follows the following flow:

  1. Request a Code Review http://code.google.com/p/google-api-dotnet-client/issues/entry?show=review&former=sourcelist. Coordinate with the team member assigned for that Issue to better coordinate the efforts and make sure we're not duplicating work. This team member will also be responsible for pulling in your changeset into the official repository at the end of the process (unless you are an official contributor).
  1. Sign in to http://codereview.appspot.com and create a new "Issue". Make sure to use the upload.py tool. Specify the "Issue" number from this client library project Issue Tracker. Unfortunately, the term "Issue" is confusingly used to mean two different things between the code review tool and the Issue Tracker.
If you are not an official Contributor, after completing the code review process and receiving approval, a Contribtor will pull in your changeset into the official repository.
